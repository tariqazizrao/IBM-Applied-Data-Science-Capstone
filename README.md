## Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Success Using Machine Learning

This capstone project, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera, demonstrates the practical application of data science skills through a real-world scenario. The objective is to **predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings**, which directly impacts launch costs and operational planning.

## üîç Problem Statement

SpaceX has significantly reduced launch costs by reusing its Falcon 9 boosters. This project aims to:
- Identify factors influencing landing success (e.g., payload mass, orbit type, launch site, booster reuse).
- Track landing success trends over time.
- Develop a **binary classification model** to predict landing outcomes.
